# COS126_4_Recursive_Graphics
Assignment 4 of Princeton University's introductory programming course (COS 126) 
This assignment contains three parts: The first consists of creating static methods for geometric transformations
The second involves creating a Sierpinski Triangle through recursion
The third is a custom art project, also created using recursion. For this, I created a series of squares that successively gets tilted outwards to create a "hand of cards" arrangement.
